When I was little I could think of many interesting things I wanted to do in life: F16 pilot, firefighter, astronaut, â€¦ . But in the end I decided to settle on a life as a computer programmer. I was attracted by all those exciting combinations you can make with just a 1 and 0. The craftsmanship it takes to create a computer programme, the beauty of the code, the simplicity of just 2 digits and yet so much potential power, like poetry.

I did a degree in IT, but in the end life as a programmer didn't appeal. I did another degree in Photography and ended up working as a press photographer for a small local paper. Years later, I did another degree (I collect them) and became a web designer.

All well and good, but something was missing. A proper grounding in graphic design. So I went to New York and did an intensive graphic design course at Shillington. Not quite a degree, but much better and way faster.
